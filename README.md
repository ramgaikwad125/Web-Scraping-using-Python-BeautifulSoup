# Webscrapping of NSE Options chain using Python BeautifulSoup:
We can see the daily live data of option chain on the NSE official website. If we want to build own strategies and calcuations to trade on options then we need the complete option chain. And it's very complicated and time wasting to record one by one. But we can get the complete option chain in one click in python using the some python libraries.

Note: This is only usefull to understand the how web scraping works in python don't scrap the NSE data for commercial use.
